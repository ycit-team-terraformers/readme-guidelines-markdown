# Repository Naming Conventions
Terraformers will use a Semantic Approach to Naming GitHub repositiories, which aims to provide meaning to the repository.

## Format
The name should have three sections
> `section1-section2-section3`

## Convention around information
>`[product/project name]-[purpose]-framework/language `

## Examples
```
GKE-infrastructure-terraform
repository-documentation-mardown
```
